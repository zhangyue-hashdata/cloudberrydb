## Benefits of Contribution

There are many reasons to contribute to Cloudberry and open source
projects in general. Here are some of the benefits of participating:

* Growing your network. Working with Cloudberry in open source can
help connect you with people working on similar things. You can get
help or give help, and you might even make a real-life acquaintance!

* Improving your skills. When you work on a Cloudberry issue or Pull
Request, inevitably you'll learn more about how something works in our
project; either by asking questions and gathering info or by digging
deeper into the code yourself. There’s a skill-building benefit to
contributing to open source projects.

* Becoming an expert. You might start new to a project like Cloudberry
or PostgreSQL, and by building things and opening issues when you
encounter a new challenge or a bug, you’ll learn a ton over time. You
could find your knowledge of said project has grown so much that
you’ve become an expert.

* Speaking at conferences or more community events. With those skills
you’ve earned yourself working in open source, you can let other
people hear from you, and build your professional reputation through
these community activities.

* Getting free swag! By participating in GitHub and other community
channels, you can become eligible for free swag that the Cloudberry
team offers as a way to say thank you.

There are undoubtedly more benefits than those listed here. Hope you
enjoy your contribution to the Cloudberry community!
